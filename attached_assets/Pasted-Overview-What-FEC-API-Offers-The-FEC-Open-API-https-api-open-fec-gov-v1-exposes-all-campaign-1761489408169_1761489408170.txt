Overview — What FEC API Offers

The FEC Open API (https://api.open.fec.gov/v1/) exposes all campaign finance data filed with the U.S. Federal Election Commission — covering donors, PACs, candidates, committees, expenditures, and election filings.

You can use it to track:

Which corporations or PACs gave money

Who the recipients were (candidates or committees)

When and how much was given

Which party or office (Senate, House, President) the recipients belong to

What the money was used for (disbursement purpose)

And even how much each PAC has on hand or spends in each election cycle
