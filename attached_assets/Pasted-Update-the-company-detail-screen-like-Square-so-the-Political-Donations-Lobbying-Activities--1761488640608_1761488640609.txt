Update the company detail screen (like Square) so the “Political Donations”, “Lobbying Activities”, and “Public Statements & Actions” sections are ready to display real data later, using realistic mock data now.

🧠 General Concept

Each company will soon connect to public datasets like the Federal Election Commission (FEC) API and OpenSecrets API, which track corporate political donations and lobbying.
For now, the prototype must show how those data fields will appear using mock data placeholders.

🏛 Political Donations Section

Purpose:
Show if a company or its PAC (Political Action Committee) donates to political candidates or committees.

Mock Data Fields (to include in JSON or local object):

{
  "available": true,
  "pacName": "Block Inc. PAC",
  "totalDonations": 195000,
  "lastDonationDate": "2024-08-12",
  "partyBreakdown": [
    { "party": "Democratic", "amount": 120000 },
    { "party": "Republican", "amount": 75000 }
  ],
  "topRecipients": [
    { "name": "Jane Doe (D-CA)", "amount": 15000 },
    { "name": "John Smith (R-TX)", "amount": 12000 }
  ],
  "source": "FEC API"
}


Display Rules (UI):

If available: false → show “No political donation data available.”

If available: true:

Show PAC name: “Corporate PAC: Block Inc. PAC”

Show total donations: “Total political contributions: $195K (2023–2024)”

Show party breakdown: “62% Democratic / 38% Republican” (use a horizontal bar for ratio)

Show last activity: “Last political activity: Aug 2024”

Optionally list top recipients (two names with party tags)

Add source line: “Source: FEC API (mock data)”

🏛 Lobbying Activities Section

Purpose:
Later will show data from the OpenSecrets API about lobbying spending.

Mock structure:

{
  "available": false,
  "totalLobbyingSpend": null,
  "lastFilingYear": null,
  "topIssues": []
}


UI Behavior:
Keep “No lobbying data available” for now.

💬 Public Statements & Actions Section

Purpose:
Show known corporate initiatives or positions.

Mock data example:

{
  "available": true,
  "tags": ["Small business focus"]
}


Display tags as rounded pills or badges.

🧭 Impact Score Context

Keep Impact Score visible (e.g., “68 — Mixed record on democratic values”).
Later, this will be recalculated automatically based on donation ratios from FEC data.

🧾 Data Source Footer

Update footer text to:

Data sources: FEC API (mock), OpenSecrets (future), verified corporate and news data. Last updated: Oct 2024.

✅ Minimum UI Expectations

“Political Donations” card shows either:

grey placeholder (no data), or

full info (PAC name, totals, ratio, last activity, and recipients).

“Lobbying Activities” card stays empty.

“Public Statements” card shows one or more example tags.

Keep consistent spacing, rounded cards, light backgrounds.

Include “Impact Score” and “Neutral / Progressive / Conservative” tag as now.

🧠 Example Mock Companies

Add 2–3 mock profiles to demo variations:

Company	Political Profile	Example Summary
Square (Block Inc.)	Balanced / Neutral	PAC exists, moderate donations to both parties
ExxonMobil	Conservative	80% of donations to Republican candidates
Patagonia	Progressive	Majority of donations to Democratic candidates
